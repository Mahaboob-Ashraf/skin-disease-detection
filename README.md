# Skin Disease Detection

This project applies **deep learning techniques** to classify dermatoscopic images of skin lesions from the **HAM10000 dataset** into 7 diagnostic categories.  

## Goals
- Explore and analyze the HAM10000 dataset.
- Build and train a deep learning model for skin disease classification.
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, F1-score, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Generate explainability visualizations (Grad-CAM).
- Save the trained model and provide a lightweight demo application (optional).

## Structure
- `notebooks/` : Google Colab notebooks for exploration, training, and evaluation  
- `models/` : Saved trained models  
- `docs/` : Visualizations (plots, Grad-CAM)  
- `data/` : Dataset (not included due to size)  

## Dataset
[HAM10000 dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)
